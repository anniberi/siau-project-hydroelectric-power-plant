# siau-project-hydroelectric-power-plant
This is my project for the course SIAU in which I have simulated a hydroelectric power plant.

There are two main files in this project - the "main.py" file inside of "finalna_verzija" and the file "finalni_miC.py". 

Everything in "finalna_verzija" is for QtCreator - it uses PyQt6. The contents of "finalna_verzija" can be ran as a project in QtCreator. This part of the hydroelectric power plant is the control room of the power plant. 

The file "finalni_miC.py" is the dam of the power plant. This file can be ran through the console on any computer with an internet connection. When that is done, and the Qt project is ran, they then communicate with each other through MQTT.

Through the control room of the simulation you can see the current state of the dam, the amount of water in the hydroelectric power plant and the current power that is being generated by the power plant. It is also possible to change the state of the dam. You can also see how filled up is the water pool of the plant in percentages on the side. Besides all of that, you can save the current state of the power plant as a picture and also change the text color into a random color.

The UML diagrams for this project are located in "UML dijagrami".
